Simple script used to wrap ExtJS panels in an iScroll widget allowing
mobile webkit clients (iPhone, iPad, etc) to scroll content inside a 
fixed width/height element.

This script was developed using ExtJS 4.0 and iScroll 4.2 and tested on
an iPad 3 (iOS 6). More information on iScroll can be found here:
